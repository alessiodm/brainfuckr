A very simple Brainf*ck interpreter!

I wrote this in 45 minutes for a challenge. Okey, I've to be honest: I've added tests laterâ€¦ TDD please forgive me! :)

The *comma* symbol is not implemented, so you cannot give inputs to the interpreter, but you should be able to do some fun stuff with it!

Enjoy!
